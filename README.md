## Summary ##
This project is for the institute library. The purpose of this project is to
automate part of the book recommendation workflow which is currently being done
through google sheets.

The context for this project is the following: 

- we have a [book recommendation system](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgUek_iRK71V2WYsErVSfoAb-YQu5_HjTvTyRntAKNjClh9Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) in the institute.

- there are several stages of the book acquisition which the librarian has to manually maintain in huge spreadsheets.

- this is creating difficulty as the volume of all new purchase data that the library is getting high. This is only going to grow as the institute grows.

To help the librarian, we need to build a chhootu webpage that can help track all the requests and their stages.

## Stages of a book acquisition ##

## Implementation ##
You can assume that the list of new books is given as a CSV file (sample
CSV added to the repo). This will be the input to Stage 1.

Create a separate page for each stage displaying the relevant information (like
a spreadsheet with proper header ISBN, title etc) but without any ability to
edit them. Each page should list a max of 10 books. The remaining books must be
[paginated](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_pagination.asp) and
displayed.

After the list of the books are displayed, at the end of each stage (except the
last stage), there is a button which upon clicking will move all those books
selected in that stage (using check boxes) to be moved to the next stage.

In each stage, a short description of the stage should be provided at the
beginning. Also, a facility to download the books in stage i (for i in
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}) should be provided.

## Data import ##
As of now support for manual data entry (via csv) in stage 1 is supported. 
THis is already implemented. To ensure smooth usage, we need to support the following also.
* Provide a sample CSV in which the data can be uploaded.
* A "preview" functionality where the uploaded data can be previewed and verified that eveything is in order before adding to the database.
